RogueEngine
===========

The main goal for project is to offer a roguelike engine with sufficient features to supply a game with a lot of colaborative content in it.

We are currently in the very early stages of planning and developing, and as we want to develop a game that represents very closely the Tolkien Mitology, we are searching for content creators and 'tolkien geeks'.

How can I help?
---------------

Just contact me (at _felipe.oltavares@gmail.com_)and try to describe the best of yourself. What can you do best? Show it to me. Show how much you like Tolkien and Lord Of The Rings, how precisely you know the details.
But, only try to go aboard if you love roguelikes ;) GO! GO! GO!
